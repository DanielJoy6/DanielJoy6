Hello there! 

My name is Daniel Joy, I'm a first-year Master's student at University of Tennessee Knoxville interested in cybersecurity, machine learning, and renewable energy.

Some of my projects:
- [Tic-Tac-Toe Q-learning Agent](https://github.com/DanielJoy6/TicTacToe-Bot) - Q-learning reinforcement agent that self-plays and learns how to play Tic-Tac-Toe
  * Topics: Q-table, Reinforcement Learning, Self-Play, Machine Learning
- [Roblox Cashier Bot](https://github.com/DanielJoy6/RobloxCashier) - Bot using simulated mouse clicks and Convolution Neural networks to act as a cashier in a Roblox game
  * Topics: Convolutional Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Python Libraries: PyAutoGui, DirectInput, Keras, Tensorflow
- [Q-learning Sushi-Go Agent](https://github.com/DanielJoy6/Sushi-go-bot) - A reinforcement self-learning bot that learned to play the card game Sushi-Go optimally. Reached 70% win rate against simple opponents
  * Topics: Q-Learning, Python, Reinforcement Learning
- [Melting Point Prediction](https://github.com/DanielJoy6/Melting-point) - Organic molecule melting point prediction using gradient boosting & neural networks
  * Topics: Neural Networks, Machine Learning, LightGBM, XGBoost
